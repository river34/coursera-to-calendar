# Coursera to Calendar

This extension adds Coursera deadlines to the google calendar, so that you won't miss important benchmarks, and finish the online course on time!

## Instructions:
- Navigate to the "Grades" page of a course
- Click the extension icon on the browser bar
- Wait for google calendar events to be generated, and confirm each one of them

## Notes:
- If there are a lot of deadlines in the "Grade" page, it might take a while to add them all to the calendar
- You need to manually confirm each calendar event to add it

## Add to chrome:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coursera-to-calendar/cbehklpdmnjgpihbafndppmgkakabmpe

## Dev plans:
- To open the "Grades" page for a course, if the user is not currently at one
- To have the option to add only the future deadlines
- To have the option to add individual deadline
- To support other online course systems, like Udemy
- To incorporate the new gapi
